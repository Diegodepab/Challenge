remove elements from a list that belongs to an auxiliary list:
You are given two iterables: the first is a list of 1000000 numbers, and the second iterable contains the odd numbers from the first list. The task is to remove the elements that are present in the second list from the original list. Note that efficiency is of utmost importance, and the code should not take more than one second to complete.

It would be highly appreciated if the extraction is performed one by one, and the possibility that the list could consist of objects rather than numbers as in the example should be considered
